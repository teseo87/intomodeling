                                <h3>Becoming a Commercial Model</h3>
<p class="font14"><strong>Commercial modeling is the most popular area 
of modeling in the industry. Commercial models become very successful 
and develop lucrative professional careers by appearing in 
advertisements, magazines and catalogues.</strong></p>
<p>There are many areas to choose from. They may vary from promotional 
modeling, for example at a sporting event or a trade fair, to 
advertising a product or brand, like garden furniture or phone systems.</p>
<p>Commercial models promote products and services all over the media, 
such as television and the internet as well as in print ads. They appear
 in commercials, on product packaging, in magazines and on billboards. 
This is, without a doubt, the most inclusive and assorted type of 
modeling. For more information about commercial modeling, read&nbsp;Into
 Modeling blogs.</p>
<p>The conditions for commercial modeling are not very strict. Depending
 on what the client envisions for the advertisement is what the look is 
ultimately based upon. Many successful commercial models look like 
normal, regular people. However, they stand out for their ability to 
express emotion and replicate that same look time and time again on 
demand. As clients often look for models with personality, versatility 
and great acting ability, besides the right look, actors sometimes 
explore the world of commercial modelling. Good commercial models are 
usually photogenic. Having an original look is great but not absolutely 
necessary.</p>
