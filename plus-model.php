                                <h3>Becoming a +Size Model</h3>
<p class="font14"><strong>To become a model, it is important look like 
one and photograph well. However, at Into Modeling we do not promote the
 “size zero” model which leads to an unhealthy approach to body image. 
We embrace aspiring models of all shapes and sizes.</strong></p>
<p>As you can see from the Dove Girls, casting directors are now looking
 for real women to carry out their campaigns. The modeling industry has 
changed a lot over the years and models with curves and plus size models
 are in demand more than ever before with brands such as Bravissimo and 
Simplybe.com becoming market leaders.</p>
<p>Plus-size model Robyn Lawley has become a superstar in the modeling 
industry, headlining the world’s most desired magazine covers and 
campaigns. Magazines like Vogue Italia and French Elle have featured the
 23-year-old’s curves, and she has even become the first plus-sized 
model ever to star in a Ralph Lauren campaign. This is tearing down 
every preconception that smaller is more beautiful.</p>
<p>Plus sized models should have a great look and lots of charisma. They need to be confident with their 14 – 18 size body.</p>
