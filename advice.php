<h4>Attitude</h4>
<p>You need to have the right attitude to be a model. This includes 
three key ingredients: patience, discipline and self-confidence. There 
is no point having one without the other two. You’ll need all three in 
equal measure.</p>
<h4>Your Rights</h4>
<p>A model will be confronted with difficult situations in their career 
when it comes to chasing their images, getting paid for a job or even 
dealing with sexual harassment. It is important to understand your 
rights as a model in order to know where you stand when certain 
situations come up. Below are a few tips to ensure you are always 
protected:</p>
<h4>Safety Tips</h4>
<p>The world of modeling is big and varied, with different areas 
appearing all the time. We have prepared these tips to ensure that you 
stay as safe as possible when pursuing your modeling career:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not engage with companies with no address or contact number</li>
<li>Do not engage with companies who hide behind a PO Box address</li>
<li>A good model is a smart model – use your common sense and don’t be afraid to say NO</li>
</ul>

<h4>Freelance Modelling</h4>
<p>When a model does not have a modeling agency to represent and manage 
them, they are Freelance models. A freelance model will market his or 
herself in the industry and find modeling work by their own means. Many 
freelance models work as part time models to earn a second income.</p>
<p>Marketing yourself has never been easier since complete access to the
 internet and social networking sites became available to you. A 
freelance model can get their own work through modeling communities, 
networking events and contacting companies and clients directly. Having 
full control of their earnings and career is an advantage many models 
have chosen as a result of getting work without the aid of agencies. As a
 freelance or part-time model, you do not have a model agent to keep a 
list of contacts for you so, it is very important that you do so 
yourself. Keeping in touch with the photographers and other industry 
creatives that you work with on each shoot or at each event is the key 
to building a portfolio of contacts.&nbsp;</p>
