                                <h3>Becoming a male model</h3>
<p class="font14"><strong>The secret to seizing the right opportunity 
for male modeling, is to know what type of model you are. Then, you can 
approach the correct agency that best suits your category.</strong></p>
<p class="western" align="justify">Within male modeling, you may be 
right for commercial or high street modeling, health and fitness, 
editorial, high fashion or alternative modeling.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify">Every day, the demand for male models
 increases. From catwalks to magazines like Vogue or Men’s Health, if 
you have the right look and attitude, you could achieve great success in
 this business.</p>
<p class="western" lang="es-AR" align="justify">To get the attention of 
casting directors, you need a multifaceted portfolio. You have to take 
care of your appearance: skin, hair and physique. If you have a muscular
 body, you can target magazines like Men’s Health. If you have a 
slighter frame, you might be eligible for high fashion brands.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify">You should decide early on if you are
 willing to do underwear and swimwear modeling, since agencies might set
 you up for these jobs. There is no problem at all if you decide not to 
go for those types of castings. Follow&nbsp;Into Modeling on Twitter for
 the latest advice and modeling information.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify">Looks are not enough to become a male
 model. You need to look confident and be great on camera as well. Into 
Modeling will help you develop all your potential and see if you meet 
these standards.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify">A great attitude is vital to 
cooperate with stylists and creative directors. You must be willing to 
follow instructions and wear exactly what they want you to so as to 
carry out their vision. This may include wearing make up to accentuate 
your best features, even out your skin tone and cover any imperfections.</p>
